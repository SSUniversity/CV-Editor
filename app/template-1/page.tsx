				<h2 className="h6 uppercase text-end pb-4" id="about">about me</h2>

				<p>I am currently a senior designer at YKSoft. I live and work in Saratov and pursue a Master's degree in Computer
					Science at the Saratov State University. <br /><br />
				</p>
				<p>I began my career in design in 2018. I started as a graphic designer and eventually realized that Iâ€™m more
					interested into the sphere of interfaces and products. Since then, I managed to work with many companies and
					in various projects, such as the Venrok sports app, the Lifetables habit tracker, and the Easy-Traveling
					travel app.
					More cool and interesting cases can be viewed below on the page. <br /><br />
				</p>
				<p>At the same time, I continue to work as a graphic designer, helping such companies as Youcon Events Group,
					Jedi.University and LoyalMed with visual and identity issues.
